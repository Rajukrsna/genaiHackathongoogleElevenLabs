# PWA Support

This project now includes Progressive Web App (PWA) support via the Vite PWA plugin.

What's included:

- Service worker with offline caching (workbox runtime caching configured for API calls)
- Web app manifest (auto-generated by the Vite PWA plugin)
- Icons are included from `src/assets`

How it works:

- The service worker is registered in `src/main.tsx` (production only).
- The manifest and icons are injected at build time by the plugin.

Local testing:

1. Run `npm run build` and then `npm run preview` to serve the built site.
2. Open the site in Chrome and use DevTools > Application > Manifest to verify.

Notes & Next steps:

- Add dedicated app icons in `/public/icons` for better visuals (192x192 and 512x512 PNGs).
- Tune caching rules for other assets as needed.
