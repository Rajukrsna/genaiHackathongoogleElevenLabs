# PWA Support

This project now includes Progressive Web App (PWA) support via the Vite PWA plugin.

What's included:

- Service worker with offline caching (workbox runtime caching configured for API calls)
- Web app manifest (auto-generated by the Vite PWA plugin)
- Icons are included from `src/assets`

How it works:

- The service worker is registered in `src/main.tsx` (production only).
- The manifest and icons are injected at build time by the plugin.

Local testing:

1. Run `npm run build` and then `npm run preview` to serve the built site.
2. Open the site in Chrome and use DevTools > Application > Manifest to verify.

Notes & Next steps:

- Added a placeholder SVG icon at `/public/icons/icon.svg` (replace with proper PNGs if you prefer). ✅
- Caching rules updated: API (NetworkFirst), images (CacheFirst), fonts (StaleWhileRevalidate), and a navigation fallback are configured. ✅

Notes:
- For best results, replace `/public/icons/icon.svg` with proper PNG icons (192x192 and 512x512) and update `vite.config.ts` manifest entries if you do so.
